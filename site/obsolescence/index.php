<h1>Obsolescence is an open world, co-op “Complete the Monument” map</h1>
<p>The goal: Bring together the pieces of an ancient rite to complete the magic ritual and restore natural balance in this strange world.<p>
<p>To find the pieces for the ritual, you must defeat monsters, solve puzzles, and use Gamemode 4 Modules – our awesome survival datapacks!</p>
<p>Our data packs have been carefully crafted to compliment the vanilla game: boosted potions, ziplines, redstone-ready machines and more.<p>
<p>Throughout the map these packs will be introduced, and unlocking their true potential is key to progress.</p>
<p>Obsolesence contains enough variety for all play styles. Want lore to unpack? You can explore tattered notes and the design of the world. Looking for a challenging puzzle? Tackle a dungeon! Have a desire to go caving and fight monsters? Try and find one of our large custom caves.</p>
<h2 style="font-style:italic">Why is the world floating? What are these ruins? What is hidden behind the mysterious gates in the mountains? All this and more... in <strong>Obsolescence<strong>!<h2>
<br>
<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
